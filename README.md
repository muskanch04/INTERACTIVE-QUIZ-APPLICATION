### üß† Interactive Quiz Application

## üìò Project Description

The **Interactive Quiz Application** is a responsive and feature-rich web-based platform built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Designed to offer an engaging and educational experience, this application allows users to test their knowledge across a curated set of multiple-choice questions. It delivers a modern, user-friendly interface combined with interactive elements and real-time feedback, making it an excellent learning and self-assessment tool.

### üéØ Project Objectives

The primary goal of the project is to develop an intuitive quiz interface where users can answer a series of timed questions, receive immediate feedback, and view their performance summary. The application emphasizes clean design, responsive layout, and smooth user interactions. It not only assesses knowledge but also provides an interactive learning environment to reinforce concepts and encourage further exploration.

### üåü Key Features

#### üñ•Ô∏è Multi-Screen Layout

The application follows a structured multi-screen user experience:
- **Welcome Screen**: Presents instructions and quiz details like question count (10), time limit (30 seconds/question), and scoring rules (10 points per correct answer).
- **Quiz Screen**: Displays one question at a time with four answer options, a countdown timer, and real-time score updates.
- **Result Screen**: Shows a performance summary, including total score, number of correct and incorrect answers, accuracy percentage, and a motivational message with emojis.
- **Review Screen**: Allows users to revisit each question, view their selected answer, and compare it with the correct one for detailed learning.

#### ‚è±Ô∏è Timer & Progress Tracking

Each question comes with a **30-second countdown timer** designed to maintain user focus and add an element of challenge. A circular progress bar changes color as time runs out (turning red in the last 10 seconds), providing visual urgency. If time expires without a response, the application automatically moves to the next question.

#### üìä Scoring and Feedback

The scoring system is straightforward and effective:
- 10 points for each correct answer
- Real-time score display during the quiz
- Final analytics with:
  - Total score
  - Correct vs. incorrect answers
  - Accuracy percentage
  - Achievement message (e.g., ‚ÄúOutstanding‚Äù, ‚ÄúGood Try‚Äù, ‚ÄúKeep Learning‚Äù)

This ensures users not only receive their results but also understand their performance breakdown.

#### üß© Dynamic Question System

The application uses a dynamic question rendering system. Each of the 10 questions focuses on core web development topics like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Every question includes four answer options, immediate feedback, and automatic progression once an answer is selected or time expires. The quiz is designed to be modular and easily extendable with more questions or categories.

#### üé® Responsive & Interactive Design

Crafted with a **mobile-first approach**, the interface is fully responsive and accessible on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. The layout adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience. Visual enhancements such as hover effects, color transitions, smooth animations, and icon-based feedback further enrich the interface.

#### üìà Educational Impact

This project is more than just a quiz‚Äîit‚Äôs a learning companion. By providing immediate feedback and detailed results, it helps users identify knowledge gaps and build confidence. The review screen is especially valuable for post-quiz reflection, making the experience educational, not just evaluative.

### üîß Technical Highlights

- Written in **vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** with clean and modular code structure
- Utilizes **CSS Flexbox** and **animations** for layout and transitions
- Responsive design principles for consistent behavior across devices
- Efficient DOM manipulation and event-driven architecture for smooth interactivity
